              Are you interested in building a software tool for social good?
              We are recruiting a student assistant at the University of Amsterdam to help program a software tool for a citizen science project.
              The tool will be used by local communities in the IJmond region in the Netherlands to monitor air pollution from a steel-making factory using camera data.
              More information about the project can be found at <a href="https://ijmondcam.multix.io/">this website</a>.

                <p class="text">
                  Build a data engineering pipeline to extract video clips from the camera stream for citizens to label whether the clips contain smoke emissions or not, based on available code from the <a href="https://www.fruitpunch.ai/challenges/ai-against-toxic-clouds">AI against Toxic Clouds challenge</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                  Engineer a dashboard for local communities to better understand smoke emissions from the steel factory (e.g., how bad the emission is, how frequent the emissions are, and how likely the emissions will violate air pollution law).
